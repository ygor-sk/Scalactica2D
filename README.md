# Scalactica 2D

Scalactica 2Dd is a simulator of motion of objects in 2D space. It aims to be an interactive educatory tutorial.
Following features are planned:
- Newton's laws (uniform motion, immediate forces)
- simple drag
- simple collisions (objects get destroyed immediatelly)
- gravitational motion (tidal forces, 
- analytics of gravitational motion
- simple space rocketery, TWR, efficiency, staging

Currently out of scope
- realistic collisions (bouncing off)
- realistic drag
- realistic rocket construction
